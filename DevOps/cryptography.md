# TERMINOLOGIES

Checksums are a means of validating a digital file by examinig all the bytes/data of a file and using a CRC-32 a mathamatical formulae. There are different formulaes to use such as CRC-32, SHA1, or MD5 each with their own pros and cons listed below in order from best top to worse bottom.

SHA-256: Part of the SHA-2 family, it is much more secure and is increasingly recommended for cryptographic security.

SHA-1: More secure than MD5, but still vulnerable to certain attacks; it's also used for checksumming but is being phased out for sensitive applications.

MD5: Originally designed for checksums, itâ€™s now often considered insecure against deliberate alterations but is still 
used for checksums in many applications due to its speed.

CRC-32: Good for detecting simple errors, fast, but not as secure against intentional tampering.

SUMMARY
Best for security: SHA-256
Decent for general use: SHA-1
Fast but insecure: MD5
Good for basic error-checking: CRC-32

## CRC-32

CRC-32 is a type of checksum which is a means of validating a digital file by examinig all the bytes/data of a file and using a CRC-32 a mathamatical formulae to come up with a value which defines a file. E.g, a ROM dump of "Tetris" for Gameboy will have a CRC-32 of the below depending on the region of the game;

* Tetris (World) (Rev 1) CRC-32: 46df91ad
* Tetris (Japan) (En) CRC-32: 63f9407d

So when the original game ROM file is altered/hacked e.g, for adding color to the game, or creating custom borders for Super Gameboy use, the CRC-32 will calculate a different value.

This creates a means of testing the originality of a file, and also track down variations of it.

This website https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/crc32_checksum.html can be used for drag and dropping any digital file such as "Tetris" for Gameboy and finding any checksum such as a CRC-32 value. E.g, "46df91ad". This number coresponds to the ROM the author had copied is the original (World) region version as per above.


# COMMON COMMANDS

FIND FILE HASH
1. Download the zip file
e.g, this 64-bit zip download for a Gameboy Advance emulator file listed here - https://visualboyadvance.org/download/vba-m/
has a listed MD5 Hash of 7D86CF059BFCDBDE40F586EFDB020099
2. 
```bash
Get-FileHash "visualboyadvance-m-Win-x86_64.zip" -Algorithm MD5 # Windows
Get-FileHash "visualboyadvance-m-Win-x86_64.zip" -Algorithm SHA256 # Windows
md5 visualboyadvance-m-Win-x86_64.zip # Unix*
shasum -a 1 visualboyadvance-m-Win-x86_64.zip # Unix*

```
3. Compare the output. In this case it's the same as on the HTML page verifying the checksum is legitimate.
```bash
PS C:\Users\Sumeet\Downloads> Get-FileHash .\visualboyadvance-m-Win-x86_64.zip -Algorithm MD5
Algorithm       Hash                                                                   Path
---------       ----                                                                   ----
MD5             7D86CF059BFCDBDE40F586EFDB020099                                       
PS C:\Users\Sumeet\Downloads> Get-FileHash .\visualboyadvance-m-Win-x86_64.zip -Algorithm SHA256

Algorithm       Hash                                                                   Path
---------       ----                                                                   ----
SHA256          F656535EA605144B9444AB3DDBD93E5E3F2C27ECCC1225363787E8AB6FC092FE

HASH PASSWORD
1. Create file HashPassword.js and add any password to hash
```javascript
const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs'); // FOR SHA256, change to whatever you want

const password = 'Password1!';
const saltRounds = 10;

bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds, (err, hash) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error hashing password:', err);
  } else {
    console.log('Hashed password:', hash);
  }
});
```
2. run the file with node and the output value is the hashed password that can be entered anywhere
that is encrupted with that encryption (i.e, a MySQL DB with SHA256)
```bash
sumeetsingh@Sumeets-Air backend % node HashPassword.js
Hashed password: $2a$10$9JsnQAMsal.4iMhX.CnZXuy9aCILeipHjLt8MGf5h.JJ64KSg.uOy
