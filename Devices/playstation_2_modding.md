# TERMINOLOGIES

PS2 = Playstation 2
OPL = Open playstation loader, a software used for reading attached storage mediums on your PS2 e.g, Harddrive (HDD), through ethernet port or through
USB or Memory Card
Free Mcboot = A set of files copied onto a memory card that allows soft modding a PS2, you can then copy other software in .EFL files such as OPL onto the
memory card to then soft mod and play games digitally you own.

# MODDING

To play dumped ROMS of your PS2 games on actual hardware you can follow the steps below. They do not apply to any SCPH-9xxxx latest models
as they have inbuilt firmware to prevent hacking the device.

Watch this video to learn how, note the MX4SIO part can be skipped if you just want to use a USB.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=O8sP1Xm5MfI

The latest version of Open Playstation loader 1.2+ supports exfat attached USB's. In the authors experience there is no issue with speeds in SCPH-7xxxx+ 
slim models, but possibly there is for earlier models. Note all Playstations have use 1.1 standards and speeds which is significantly theoretically slower
then the DVD or Internal Harddrive (HDD) or even compared with running games through the Ethernet port connected to a router with a USB running Samba like sharing.

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### USB GAMES NOT APPEARING
Occurs in exfat USB storage mediums. Put your roms in the USB in either a /CD or /DVD folder then plug into PS2 and start OPL, if the games dont intiially
appear go to start menu, then quit. Then go back into OPL from main PS2 menu, and see if games appear again, if not go back into OPL settings then go directly
back again. Some times it takes a few attempts.

### GAMES WRONG COLOR
If you play a game from an incorrect region e.g, US or JAP game on a PAL console you will see incorrect colours. This is because the game sends NTSC encoding to a PAL
TV which is incorrect. To fix either use the correct region game for your console and for international region games use a a region converter for your cable e.g, for Component cables for NTSC/Japanese games in PAL console use a "ntsc to pal converter"
