# MODDING

To play dumped ROMS of your PS2 games on actual hardware you can follow the steps below. They do not apply to any SCPH-9xxxx latest models
as they have inbuilt firmware to prevent hacking the device.
Watch this video to learn how, note the MX4SIO part can be skipped if you just want to use a USB.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=O8sP1Xm5MfI

The latest version of Open Playstation loader 1.2+ supports exfat attached USB's. The speeds of running USB games is fine for many games however
for cutscene's will often have issues or with heavy intensive performance games.

Note: when you first start a game if it's a different region you will be warned but the game will start shortly after. However the colors may not appear
correct and that is due to the regions encoding not recognised by your TV. E.g, running a NTSC-US (American) game on a PAL PS2, you will get a warning
and the colors may appear all purple on a CRT TV. The recommendation is to aquire the PAL versions of the game and dump them into ISO's and transfer.
