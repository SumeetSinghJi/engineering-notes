* Version: 1.0 (October 2024)
* Description: This document outlines various ways to play backups of Gamecube game roms on your Gamecube or setup
Gameboy Interface to allow upscaling of Gameboy games to play on your TV.
The purpose was to bring life to our old childhood consoles. I do not condone piracy nor performing any activity that renders breaking a EULA or Terms and conditions contract between a product vendor and customer. I recommend to buy official licensed games and hardware.

# TERMINOLOGY
TF Card = Trans Flash card. The old name of SD cards, before it was standardised. They refer to the same thing.
SDGecko = An old device which can be substituted for any clone device from Aliexpress, but it's slow and best
to use the Serial port 2 device
Action Replay disc + exploit: Old exploit method. The discs are rare and expensive. Don't bother with this option.

# REQUIREMENTS
* DOL-001 - original gamecube with the digital AV port
* Buy a memory card from eBay with the below game exploit for your region preconfigured. Contact seller to ask.
The memory card will have the hacked game + Swiss installed on it. Swiss is the new Gamecube OS you will use.
* An game to exploit of any region, in this case Zelda Wind walker
* MicroSD Card at least 32GB FAT32 formatted
* A serial port 2 MicroSD card adapter e.g, SD2SP2 Pro ($15 AUD from amazon.com)
* A memory card of black size and up

# SWISS EXPLOIT STEPS
1. Follow this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mZQeCzvy6E&t

# PLAY BACKUP GAMES AND ROMS
1. Add .iso or .nkit.iso roms to FAT32 formatted MicroSD card, 
2. connect to SD2SP2 or similar device
then connect to serial port 2 underneath your device ensuring it's an original DOL-001 model Gamecube.
3. Boot into swiss using any exploit method as above, then change to MicroSD folder and play any game

# GAMEBOY INTERFACE SETUP
If you don't have a Gameboy player disc and dont want to purchase due to rarity and cost, you can use Gameboy
Interface which is a homebrew software run through Swiss that allows mimicing the Gameboy player disc functionality.
It also adds more functions with allowing upscaling not present in the former disc meaning it's the definitive way
to play Gameboy family games on a external monitor/TV.

Remember if your Gameboy player disc is scratched you can always have it rebuffed which is a professional job
for at least $10 AUD that a professional just removes a extremely thin layer of the disc to make it perform better.
It's not an issue if it's done once, but multiple times can cause it to be brittle, but it's a suggestion if you
want to just keep using the disc for authenticity.

Gameboy interface is a folder and files placed on the MicroSD card device connected to serial port 2.
Once you boot using the game exploit into Swiss menu, you can navigate to the MicroSD card and just run GBI.

1. Plug in any gameboy game into the Gamecube
2. Click download main package here: https://www.gc-forever.com/wiki/index.php?title=Game_Boy_Interface
3. Extract the folder, inside the app folder copy the 3 gbi folders into the MicroSD card and connect to the Gamecube e.g, using a Serial port 2 adapter as above
4. Plug into your gamecube, boot into swiss using exploit steps above, then navigate to the MicroSD card start the relevant .dol executable.
The wiki shows the 3 versions
standard = best for lcd/oled
speedrunning = best for crt
high-fidelity = best for use with upscalers
5. The game will now start in the best picture quality mode then what the standard Gameboy Player disc coul ever produce.
